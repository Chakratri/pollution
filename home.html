  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Pollution is a special case of habitat destruction; it is chemical destruction rather than the more obvious physical destruction. Pollution occurs in all habitats—land, sea, and fresh water—and in the atmosphere. Global warming, which is discussed separately below (see Global change), is one consequence of the increasing pollution of the atmosphere by emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases.

Pollution is a global-scale problem, no less so for rivers and marine life. Wastes are often dumped into rivers, and they end up in estuaries and coastal habitats, regions that support the most diverse shallow-water ecosystems and the most productive fisheries. Rivers receive pollution directly from factories that dump a wide variety of wastes into them. They also receive runoff, which is rainwater that has passed over and through the soil while moving toward the rivers. In fact, water entering rivers after it has been used for irrigation has passed through the soil more than once—first as runoff, which is then returned to the land for irrigation, whereupon it soaks through the soil again.

Some polluted river water eventually reaches freshwater wetlands. In the case of the Florida Everglades, runoff from the agricultural areas upstream adds unwanted nutrients to an ecosystem that is naturally nutrient-poor. As it does so, the vegetation changes, and species not common in the Everglades begin to take over the natural habitats.

Other polluted waters reach estuaries on the way to the oceans; estuaries are among the most polluted ecosystems on Earth. On entering the oceans, the polluted waters can harm the ecosystems there. The Mississippi River, for example, drains a basin of more than 3 million square km (1.2 million square miles), delivering its water, sediments, and nutrients and other pollutants into the northern Gulf of Mexico. Fresh water is less dense than salt water and floats on top. This upper layer contains the nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers that have run off croplands, and they fertilize the ocean’s phytoplankton, causing excessive population growth. As the masses of phytoplankton die, sink, and decompose, they deplete the water’s oxygen. Bottom dwellers such as shrimp, crabs, starfish, and marine worms suffocate and die, creating a “dead zone.”.</i></font></b></p>
