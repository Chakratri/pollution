Water pollution is a major global problem, that requires evaluation and revision of water resource policy at all levels.


Water pollution occurs when pollutants are discharged directly or indirectly into water bodies without any treatment or removal of harmful compounds. Contaminated and polluted water now kills more people than all forms of violence including wars. Natural phenomena such as volcanoes, algal blooms, storms and earthquakes also cause major changes in water quality and the ecological status of water.

The specific contaminants leading to pollution in water are various organic and inorganic chemicals, wide spectrum of pathogens especially bacteria, fungus spore, cyanobacteria, actinomycetes, etc., and physical or sensory changes such as elevated temperature and discoloration.

Pathogens can produce waterborne diseases in either human or animal hosts. Coliform bacteria are a commonly used bacterial indicator of water pollution, although not an actual cause of disease. Other microorganisms such as Burkholderia pseudomallei, Cryptosporidium parvum, Giardia lamblia, Salmonella, Novovirus and other viruses Parasitic worms sometimes found in surface waters which have caused human health problems.

Some of the pollutants like lead (Pb), arsenic (As), mercury (Hg), chromium (Cr) specially hexavalent chromium, nickel (Ni), barium (Ba), cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), selenium (Se),vanadium (V), oils and grease, pesticides, etc. are very harmful, toxic and poisonous even in PPB (parts per billion) range.
